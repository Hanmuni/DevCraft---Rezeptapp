# DevCraft---Rezeptapp

## Description

- In this project, we design an interactive web application for recipe search. 
- Users can search for recipes based on the ingredients they have or the preferences they set. 
- The focus is on front-end development skills, including semantic HTML, advanced CSS, and basic JavaScript concepts.
- The application aims to provide users with a seamless and intuitive experience to manage a variety of recipes.

### Main functions

- **Recipe management:** Users can create, edit and delete their own recipes.
- **Recipe Search:** Users can search for recipes by specifying ingredients, cuisine type, dietary preferences or meal categories.
- **Filter and sorting:** Users can filter and sort search results based on various parameters such as cooking time or popularity.
- **Detailed recipe view:** Each recipe shows a detailed view with ingredients, preparation steps and nutritional information.
- **Favorites:** Users can mark certain recipes as favorites and list all favorites.
- **Responsive design:** The application should be accessible on different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) and designed in an appealing way.

### Techstack

**Frontend framework:** The FullStack JS framework Next.js is used to create this project
**Style:** To ensure a visually appealing and consistent user interface we use CSS
